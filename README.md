# Liver Cirrhosis Analysis

## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of **Liver Cirrhosis** using clinical data. The aim is to investigate how various biomarkers (e.g., **Bilirubin**, **Copper**, **Alkaline Phosphatase**) and patient characteristics (e.g., **Age**, **Sex**) correlate with the progression of the disease. The analysis covers different stages of liver cirrhosis, with a focus on understanding gender differences, disease severity, and potential predictors of mortality or liver transplant requirements.

### Key Features:
- Data exploration and visualization to identify key clinical indicators of liver cirrhosis.
- Comparison of biomarkers across different stages of cirrhosis.
- Cross-tabulation and visualization of **gender** differences in disease progression.
- Statistical analysis of age-related trends in cirrhosis stage progression.
- Insights into survival analysis and likelihood of liver transplant in advanced stages.
