Liver Cirrhosis Analysis
Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Liver Cirrhosis using clinical data. The aim is to investigate how various biomarkers (e.g., Bilirubin, Copper, Alkaline Phosphatase) and patient characteristics (e.g., Age, Sex) correlate with the progression of the disease. The analysis covers different stages of liver cirrhosis, with a focus on understanding gender differences, disease severity, and potential predictors of mortality or liver transplant requirements.

Key Features:
Data exploration and visualization to identify key clinical indicators of liver cirrhosis.
Comparison of biomarkers across different stages of cirrhosis.
Cross-tabulation and visualization of gender differences in disease progression.
Statistical analysis of age-related trends in cirrhosis stage progression.
Insights into survival analysis and likelihood of liver transplant in advanced stages.

Usage
This project can be used for:

Clinical Research: Understanding how biomarkers change with disease progression.
Predictive Modeling: Using clinical features to predict the stage or outcome of liver cirrhosis.
Educational Purposes: To explore how data science and statistical analysis can aid in medical diagnostics and research.
The analysis in this repository uses various datasets of liver cirrhosis patients, and the findings can be helpful for clinical practitioners and researchers in hepatology.

Data Overview
The dataset used in this analysis contains information on liver cirrhosis patients, with the following key columns:

Age: Patient's age.
Sex: Patient's gender (M/F).
Stage: The stage of liver cirrhosis (ranging from Stage 1 to Stage 4).
Bilirubin: Serum Bilirubin level (a marker of liver function).
Copper: Copper level in the bloodstream.
Alk_Phos: Alkaline Phosphatase, a liver enzyme.
Albumin: A protein that may indicate liver or kidney dysfunction.
Cholesterol: Serum Cholesterol levels.
SGOT: Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase, another liver enzyme.
Platelets: Platelet count, related to blood clotting and liver function.
Prothrombin: Prothrombin time, another test related to liver function.

Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, we explore the dataset to understand patterns, correlations, and important features related to liver cirrhosis progression.

Distribution of clinical features: Distribution of Bilirubin, Albumin, and other biomarkers at various stages.
Gender-wise comparisons: Average values for clinical indicators for male and female patients.
Correlation heatmap: Identifying correlations between biomarkers and disease stages.
Statistical Analysis
ANOVA and T-tests: To determine if there are significant differences in clinical features between stages.
Survival Analysis: Analyze survival probabilities for different stages of cirrhosis and age groups.
Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to better understand the data:

Stacked Bar Chart: Visualizing the distribution of stages by gender.
Correlation Heatmap: Showing correlations between clinical features.
Boxplots: To visualize the spread and range of values for biomarkers at each disease stage.
Histograms: For the distribution of key variables like Age, Bilirubin, and Copper.
